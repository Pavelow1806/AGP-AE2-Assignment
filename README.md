# AGP-AE2-Assignment

This game engine assignment was developed in C++ using Direct X 11.

I managed to implement the following features:

- Vertex to Vertex collision detection
- 3D rendering
- 3D texture wrapping
- Importing and rendering 3D models
- Lighting using HLSL (point and directional)
- Skyboxes using cubemaps
- 3rd person camera controls
- Raycasting
- Reflective surfaces using HLSL
- Usage of Lambdas functions
- Object to object interaction
- Basic sound
- 3D maths class with matrix and vector calculations

This was completed over roughly a 3 month period.
